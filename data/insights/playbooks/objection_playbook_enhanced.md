## Price Objections: "I can't afford it" / "Too expensive"

### The Data

- **Total instances:** 277
- **Success rate:** 45.8%
- **Average sale after handling:** $124
- **Total revenue from successful handling:** $15,702

**Success Rate by Tier:**

| Tier | Count | Success Rate | Avg Sale |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| NEW | 22 | 31.8% | $109 |
| LOW | 178 | 52.8% | $94 |
| MEDIUM | 57 | 38.6% | $194 |
| HIGH | 17 | 17.6% | $550 |
| WHALE | 3 | 33.3% | $200 |

### The Psychology

Research-backed insights on why these objections occur and how to address them:

- Price objections often mask deeper concerns like budget constraints, value perception gaps, or risk aversion rather than absolute affordability; uncovering the real issue via questioning increases close rates[1][2][6].
- Shifting focus from price to **value reframing** (e.g., ROI, long-term benefits) effectively overcomes objections, as supported by sales strategies emphasizing cognitive reframing from behavioral therapy[1][4].
- Empathy + redirection** techniques, such as Feel-Felt-Found or Boomerang, reduce resistance by validating concerns and pivoting to benefits, turning objections into engagement opportunities[3].
- Price anchoring** and **contrast principle** influence perceptions; presenting price after value buildup or comparing to higher alternatives makes it seem reasonable[1][6][7].
- Disqualify ~20% of prospects fixated solely on lowest price, as they undervalue quality; focus on value-oriented buyers[2].

### Proven Techniques

- **Empathize and Redirect**: "I understand budget concerns. Let's look at how this provides [specific benefit] worth more than the cost."[1][3]
- **Feel-Felt-Found**: "I understand you feel it's expensive. Others felt the same, but found it saved them [X] over time."[3]
- **Boomerang Reframe**: Turn objection back: "Exactly why it's priced this way—it delivers superior [durability/ROI]."[3]
- **Smart Questions**: "What specifically about the price concerns you?" or "How does this compare to competitors?" to uncover issues[1][2].
- **Value Anchoring**: Discuss price after benefits; use stories/testimonials: "Clients like you saved [X]—here's how."[1][5]

### Real Examples That Worked

#### Example 1: Mikko (NO LONGER UPDATED) (LOW tier) - $2000 sale

> CREATOR: Of course, sweetie... how much do you need?
> SUB: it really cost much baby... so whatever that u can, ill really appreciate it... the surgery really cost much...
> SUB: the doctor said its around 20000 but my mom already tried borrowing from her relatives... the money i saved is only for the fone and dress that u gave me...
> **SUB:** Holy shit that's a lot.... I'm not going to even be able to put a dent in that....
> **CREATOR:** how much can u babe?
> CREATOR: any amount will be a big help...
> SUB: I think I can only do like $150, but I have to check and make sure
> SUB: Okay babyyy...
> CREATOR: Its really up to u.. no pressure babyy.
> SUB: I will if I can, babe
> CREATOR: thank u babeee
> **[SALE: $2000]**

*Why it worked: Asked about budget instead of defending price, shifting to negotiation.*

#### Example 2: Billy (MEDIUM tier) - $1000 sale

> CREATOR: It's not a pseudo costume
> CREATOR: I'm too poor for costumes.. you know that 😋
> CREATOR: Just a hint of something reminding us of it and we're off to the races lol

> **CREATOR:** Not any more
> SUB: It's not a pseudo costume
> CREATOR: Yeah that's what makes it good tho
> CREATOR: Tbh I always wanted to do that where someone is working or playing games with a mic then the partner comes in full birthday suit and tries to distract
> SUB: Yeah that's what makes it good tho

*Why it worked: Asked about budget instead of defending price, shifting to negotiation.*

### What Didn't Work

Learn from these failed attempts:

#### Example 1: Arvin (WHALE tier) - No sale

> **SUB:** This is an old sub, and I'm running a picnic gambit on him. He mentioned that he doesn't have his full budget until payday, but for now, he can send $100.

> SUB: proud wifeeyy here 😘😘
> SUB: Are u working now hubby?
> CREATOR: Hey babe im free now how are you doing?🥰
> CREATOR: Hey babe im free now how are you doing? 🥰

*Why it worked: Defended price or begged, losing frame control.*

#### Example 2: Arvin (HIGH tier) - No sale

> CREATOR: It's going to be a busy one for me. Just want d to say high, I miss you and I'm always thinking about you 😘

## Timing Objections: "Maybe later" / "Not now"

### The Data

- **Total instances:** 422
- **Success rate:** 34.6%
- **Average sale after handling:** $67
- **Total revenue from successful handling:** $9,845

**Success Rate by Tier:**

| Tier | Count | Success Rate | Avg Sale |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| NEW | 16 | 12.5% | $200 |
| LOW | 270 | 41.1% | $44 |
| MEDIUM | 70 | 34.3% | $104 |
| HIGH | 28 | 21.4% | $251 |
| WHALE | 38 | 7.9% | $183 |

### The Psychology

Research-backed insights on why these objections occur and how to address them:

- Timing objections ("maybe later," "let's revisit next quarter") mask deeper concerns: other priorities feel more important or urgency isn't perceived[1]
- Objections are signs of interest, not rejection—they indicate the prospect sees value but has hesitation about commitment timing[5]
- Late-stage timing hesitations stem from commitment anxiety and final risk assessment psychology, not buyer fickleness[2]
- Sellers who successfully handle objections achieve close rates as high as 64%[7]
- The psychological foundation of timing objections involves fear of negative outcomes and implementation disruption[2]
- Active listening and validation (not agreement) reduce emotional intensity and create space for objective evaluation[2][3]

### Proven Techniques

**1. The "Feel, Felt, Found" Method**
**2. Labeling Technique (Negotiation Psychology)**

### Real Examples That Worked

### What Didn't Work

#### Example 1: Arvin (LOW tier) - No sale

> CREATOR: This is a new sub, perfectly qualified.

## Trust Objections: "Is it worth it?" / "How do I know?"

### The Data

- **Total instances:** 99
- **Success rate:** 43.4%
- **Average sale after handling:** $83
- **Total revenue from successful handling:** $3,556

**Success Rate by Tier:**

| Tier | Count | Success Rate | Avg Sale |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| NEW | 6 | 33.3% | $38 |
| LOW | 67 | 47.8% | $49 |
| MEDIUM | 20 | 35.0% | $227 |
| HIGH | 4 | 50.0% | $155 |
| WHALE | 2 | 0.0% | $0 |

### The Psychology

Research-backed insights on why these objections occur and how to address them:

- Buyers form impressions of trustworthiness in as little as 100 milliseconds, making rapid rapport essential for sales success[2].
- Strong early rapport increases perceived collaboration and makes buyers 2–3x more likely to share insights, boosting win rates[2].
- Social proof via testimonials and case studies accelerates buyer confidence and raises conversion rates[1].
- Consistent omnichannel touches (5-8 interactions) build familiarity; quick follow-ups increase deal wins by 35-50%[1].
- Trust comprises four factors: capability, dependability, integrity, and intimacy; it's a top driver of client loyalty per *Insight Selling* research[3].

### Proven Techniques

- **Leverage Social Proof**: Share client testimonials, case studies, and peer reviews early to borrow credibility from similar customers[1].
- **Mirror and Match**: Align speech pace, tone, and energy (e.g., upbeat for conversational buyers, slow for reflective ones) to signal partnership[2].
- **Active Listening with Summaries**: Reflect back key points (e.g., "To recap, your challenges are real-time data and integration") to show understanding and build intimacy[2][4].
- **Create Positive Tension**: Validate first ("I see why you've done it that way"), then ask "What if sticking with status quo costs X?" or "Why did the previous solution fail?" using inclusive language like "We might consider..."[1].
- **Quick, Consistent Follow-Ups**: Respond rapidly across channels (email, phone, video) with personalized references to prior talks; use voice/video for authenticity[1].

### Real Examples That Worked

#### Example 1: Benny (MEDIUM tier) - No sale

> SUB: I had this 35 y/o guy who works in a gold mining company and he just wanna talk for real..
> SUB: He tip $100 for the valentines and I said I will buy a dress..
> SUB: I've ask many questions for him to get to know him and for him to be vulnerable and open a lot..
> **SUB:** meaning if he invested a lot and talk about more about himself.. he will feel good and he will trust more..

## Need Objections: "I don't need it" / "Not interested"

### The Data

- **Total instances:** 196
- **Success rate:** 36.2%
- **Average sale after handling:** $72
- **Total revenue from successful handling:** $5,116

**Success Rate by Tier:**

| Tier | Count | Success Rate | Avg Sale |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| NEW | 14 | 0.0% | $0 |
| LOW | 105 | 45.7% | $43 |
| MEDIUM | 49 | 36.7% | $149 |
| HIGH | 20 | 20.0% | $68 |
| WHALE | 8 | 12.5% | $100 |

### The Psychology

Research-backed insights on why these objections occur and how to address them:

- Desire precedes purchase**: Interest must come first, followed by desire. Desire is elicited when prospects verbalize "I want" or "I don't want" statements[1]
- Need vs. Want distinction**: Positions (stated needs like "I don't need it") differ from interests (underlying reasons why they want something). Uncovering interests reveals the true motivation behind objections[4]
- Scarcity increases perceived value**: Limited-supply messaging can increase conversion rates by up to 330%, making offerings seem more necessary[5]
- Reciprocity creates obligation**: Providing value before asking creates psychological debt that makes prospects more receptive to subsequent requests[3][4]
- Autonomy matters**: Prospects resist feeling forced; offering choices and control increases receptiveness, even when options are limited[3]
- "What would having [benefit] help you achieve?"

### Proven Techniques

**Uncover Interests Behind "I Don't Need It" Objections**
- "What would having [benefit] help you achieve?"
- "What concerns do you have about this?"
- "What would change your mind about needing this?"

I wanted your time.

### The Psychology

Research-backed insights on why these objections occur and how to address them:

- Small commitments lead to larger ones by leveraging the foot-in-the-door technique, reducing hesitation and building momentum toward purchase[1].
- Approximately two-thirds of sales objections stem from psychological barriers like risk aversion and cognitive biases rather than price, with loss aversion making buyers twice as sensitive to potential losses as gains[2][3].
- % of deals are lost to customer indecision due to unaddressed fears, stress, and decision fatigue, which impair rational prefrontal cortex function[1][4].
- Objections often mask emotional concerns (e.g., fear of regret or mistake), requiring empathy and reframing to address subconscious drivers like cognitive dissonance[2][3].
- Labeling objections explicitly (e.g., "It seems like you're concerned about commitment") reduces their emotional intensity, per negotiation psychology research[2].

### Proven Techniques

- **Foot-in-the-Door for Commitment**: Start with tiny asks (e.g., "Can we chat for 2 minutes?" or "Would you like a free sample?") to build consistency and reduce commitment friction[1].
- **Feel-Felt-Found**: Acknowledge hesitation ("I understand you feel hesitant"), relate ("Others felt the same"), resolve ("But they found it worthwhile after trying")[3].
- **Labeling and Reframing**: Name the concern ("Sounds like commitment worries you") then reframe from loss to gain ("This small step unlocks exclusive access without risk")[2].
- **Risk Reduction**: Offer pilots, guarantees, or phased commitments (e.g., "Start with one custom message pack, cancel anytime") to mitigate pain of paying and fear[1][2].
- **Boomerang and Testimonials**: Flip objection back positively ("Exactly why this fits—others hesitated too, see their results") using social proof to build trust[3].
