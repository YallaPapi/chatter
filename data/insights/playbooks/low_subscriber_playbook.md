## LOW SUBSCRIBER PLAYBOOK

### Quick Profile
**Who they are**
- Low monthly spenders who *can* still stack multiple small buys.
- Often casual, lonely, curious, or “testing” the creator before spending.
- Not always online daily. They disappear and return.

**What they want**
- Fast attention + “real convo” vibe (location/job/what they’re doing).
- Clear sexual direction (they want you to lead).
- Small, satisfying “wins” (better view, close-up, toy, next part).

**Typical behavior**
- Replies to simple questions. Ignores long paragraphs.
- Buys after arousal spikes (rating, fantasy, “show me” moment).
- Caps out after 2–4 PPVs unless you pace and checkpoint budget.
- Responds well to reward-based discounts *after* a purchase.

### Opening Strategy

**Goal:** get a reply first. No prices. No menu. No “buy my PPV” opener.

**Recommended openers (copy/paste)**
1) “hey babe 😚 what are you up to right now?”
2) “hi you 😏 where are you from?”
3) “are you here for a little surprise?”
4) “you’re giving naughty vibes… am i right? 😌”
5) “quick question… butt or tits kinda guy?”

**What to avoid**
- Opening with price: “I have a $9.99 video.”
- Long intros: more than 1–2 lines.
- Hard explicit right away if he’s still “normal.”
- Guilt/pressure: “support me” / “why aren’t you buying?”

### Conversation Flow

**Core arc:** Rapport → Qualify → Tease → Offer specific visual → Gate (PPV/tip) → Aftercare + Next step

#### Step-by-step escalation (use this order)
1) **Rapport hook (1–2 messages)**
   - “where you from babe?”
   - “what you doing tonight?”
   - “work tomorrow or you off?”

2) **Qualify (find his button)**
   - “butt or tits?”
   - “do you like sweet teasing… or nasty dirty talk?”
   - “you want something *wilder* than my posts? 👀”

3) **Tease (paint a picture, don’t give it away)**
   - “i’m not wearing much rn…”
   - “i keep touching my thighs thinking about you…”
   - “if i gave you a close-up… would you behave?”

4) **Trigger a “yes” (micro-commitment)**
   - “rate me 1–10… be honest 🙈”
   - “should i tease… or show you?”
   - “you want a better view?”

5) **Offer a *specific* visual (describe the benefit)**
   - “i can show you a close-up in this angle…”
   - “i’ll twerk for you so you can see it bounce…”
   - “i’ll slide it to the side… slowly 😈”

6) **Gate it (PPV/tip) at peak interest**
   - “unlock it and i’ll show you right now.”
   - “tip and i’ll give you the better view 😚”

7) **After purchase: reward + chain**
   - “good boy… did that turn you on?”
   - “want part 2 with [toy/position/close-up]… or should i tease you first?”

#### Key checkpoints (don’t skip)
- **Before first gate:** confirm interest  
  - “you actually wanna see it… or you just teasing me? 😏”
- **After 2nd PPV:** budget check without killing the vibe  
  - “wanna keep going with something small… or save the next part for later? 😚”
- **If he goes quiet:** re-hook with a question  
  - “still with me babe? what would you do to me if i was in your bed?”

### Pricing Strategy

**Recommended price ranges (LOW tier)**
- **Small PPV unlocks:** $6.99–$9.99  
- **Tip gates for “better view / right now”:** $10  
- **Mid-step “upgrade” unlock:** $12–$15  
- **Goal:** stack 2–5 small buys per session instead of one big ask.

**How to present prices (say benefit first, price second)**
- “i can show you an even better view… unlock it 😈”
- “want the close-up? i’ll send it locked (only $7.99)”
- “tip $10 and i’ll do it right now… no waiting 😚”

**When to offer discounts**
- **Only after** they tip/buy (reward behavior).
- Use it as praise + momentum:
  - “mm you’re good to me… i’ll put a little discount on the next one ❤️”
- Never discount to “convince” a cold sub.

---

### Closing Scripts

**3–5 closers that convert (copy/paste)**
1) “should i slide it to the side… or tease you a little first? 😈”
2) “still think i’m a 100/10 if you see me twerking…?”
3) “want the close-up right now… yes or no? 😚”
4) “tell me what you want: toy… fingers… or a slow strip?”
5) “unlock it for me and i’ll do exactly what you’re imagining…”

**Soft urgency techniques (LOW subs respond best to these)**
- “right now” immediacy: “i’m doing it right now…”
- “momentum” language: “okay… i’m about to…”
- “don’t make you wait”: “come on… i won’t make you wait 😏”

---

### Red Flags

**Signs they won’t buy (or not today)**
- Only compliments, no engagement: “so hot” “nice” (no questions, no requests).
- Repeated “free?” “send preview” “show me first.”
- Dodges every gate: “later” “maybe” “idk” after 2 attempts.
- Negotiates aggressively before buying anything.

**When to disengage (keep it polite, keep the door open)**
- After **2 failed gates** with no counter-action:
  - “mm okay babe 😚 i’ll let you enjoy the tease for now… message me when you’re ready for the naughty part.”
- If they demand free content:
  - “i don’t do free explicit, but i *will* make it worth it when you unlock 😌”

---

### Golden Rules (must-follow)
- **1) No price in the first message.** Get a reply, then qualify, then tease.
- **2) Ask questions constantly.** Questions create momentum and reveal what to sell.
- **3) Gate at the peak.** Sell right after “yes / rate / better view / horny” signals.
- **4) Small-step ladder beats big asks.** Stack $7–$15 unlocks with a “part 2” story.
- **5) Discount only as a reward.** Never as desperation. Train buying behavior.

If you share your exact vault categories (twerk, close-up, toy, nude, BJ, penetration, etc.) + your preferred price points, I can turn this into a **message map with decision branches** (what to send based on “butt guy” vs “tits guy,” and a 5-step PPV ladder per kink).
