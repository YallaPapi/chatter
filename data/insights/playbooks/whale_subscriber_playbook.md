## WHALE SUBSCRIBER PLAYBOOK

### Quick Profile
- **Who they are**
  - High-spend subs who pay to *feel chosen* and *in control of the bond*.
  - They don’t need “permission” to spend. They need a reason that fits their identity.
- **What they want**
  - GFE energy (hubby/baby dynamic), exclusivity, personalization, continuity.
  - Clear structure: customs, bundles, deposits, installments, multi-month deals.
- **Typical behavior**
  - Fast emotional attachment. Uses pet names. Compliments a lot.
  - Tests attention (“you ignored me”), asks logistics (“how long?”, “what outfit?”).
  - Negotiates timing (payday) more than price.

### Opening Strategy

**Goal:** Start like you already have a relationship + reference something real + tease a next step.

#### Recommended openers (copy-paste)
1) “Good morning hubby 😘 I missed you. Tell me what you’re craving from me today?”
2) “Hey baby… I’m finally free now. Are you busy or can I steal you for a bit? 😇”
3) “Heeey love, I disappeared earlier—long day. Come here… what do you want me to do to you tonight?”
4) “Hubbyyyy 😏 I was thinking about that thing you like… want me to make you something *exclusive*?”
5) “I just got home and I’m in a mood… should I be sweet for you or naughty? 😈”

#### What to avoid
- “hey wyd” / cold starts with no context.
- Generic PPV spam (“new drop!”) with no personalization.
- Over-explaining or apologizing for being busy.
- Starting with price in message #1 (set emotion first, then monetize fast).

### Conversation Flow

#### Step-by-step escalation (use this structure)
1) **Bond (2–10 messages)**
   - Use labels: hubby/baby/love.
   - Mirror his vibe + validate.
   - Ask 1 focused question to pull specifics.
   - Example prompts:
     - “What part of me are you thinking about right now?”
     - “Outfit: skirt + heels… or lingerie?”
2) **Build a specific visual (3–6 lines)**
   - Paint a scene with details (outfit, position, tone, setting).
   - Confirm his preferences.
   - “Okay… black heels, slow teasing, then I let you have me exactly how you like.”
3) **Offer ONE paid next step (clear + exclusive)**
   - Pick one: PPV / custom / deposit / bundle.
   - Keep it simple: what he gets + price + when.
4) **If resistance → structure, don’t discount**
   - Split payment (deposit now, rest payday).
   - Or add value (extra clip, longer cut, bonus photo set).
5) **Close with assumptive action**
   - “Send the deposit and choose: romantic or dirty talk?”
6) **After payment: deliver fast + keep the loop open**
   - Thank + affection + tease the next upgrade.
   - “I loved making that for you… want part 2 even dirtier?”

#### Key checkpoints (pounce moments)
- **He compliments you / uses pet names** → he’s primed.
  - Respond with warmth + immediate offer setup.
- **He asks logistics (length/outfit/when)** → he’s already buying.
  - Move to structure + price confidently.
- **He’s jealous/neediness (“ignoring me”)** → reassurance → “make it up to you” paid moment.
- **He starts describing specifics** (positions, outfits, phrases) → lock it into a custom/bundle.

### Pricing Strategy

#### Recommended price ranges (use as defaults)
- **$100–$150:** maintenance tips / quick “make it up to you” / short PPV.
- **$200:** strongest “today close” price (deposit or single premium PPV).
- **$400–$700:** customs + bundles (where whales naturally land).
- **$1,000–$1,500+:** “help me” hero tips / special situations / big appreciation.
- **$3,500–$4,050:** multi-month GFE/package commitments.

#### How to present prices (language that works)
- Casual confidence + “for you” framing + benefit stack.
- Copy-paste:
  - “Okay hubby 😘 I can do that *exclusive for you* for **$200** and I’ll start as soon as you send it.”
  - “For **$400**, I’ll make it custom with your exact outfit + dirty talk + a longer ending.”
  - “If you want the full fantasy (longer + extra clip), I can bundle it for **$700**.”

#### When to offer discounts (rare)
- Don’t “discount.” **Restructure.**
- Use these instead:
  - **Deposit:** “Send **$200** now to lock it in, and the rest after your salary.”
  - **Add value:** “I’ll keep the price, but I’ll add an extra mini clip for you.”
  - **Event anchor:** “Black Friday / Sunday special—exclusive bundle.”

**Counter small offers**
- If he says: “Can I do $100 for now?”
- Reply: “Baby, do **$200** so I can lock it in and start filming for you. We can handle the rest on payday.”

### Closing Scripts

#### 3–5 closing phrases that work (copy-paste)
1) “Deal, hubby 😘 Send the **$200 deposit** and tell me: heels or no heels?”
2) “I’m ready to film *right now* for you. Tip **$400** and I’ll make it exactly how you described.”
3) “I’ll lock this as **exclusive for you** once the tip is in. Romantic… or filthy dirty talk?”
4) “Last and final one today, baby: **$200** and I’ll send it immediately after.”
5) “Custom ready 😈 As soon as you send, I’m yours.”

#### Urgency techniques (subtle, effective)
- **Time-box:** “today / right now / before I sleep.”
- **Availability scarcity:** “I’m free for the next hour.”
- **Event-based:** “weekend special / Black Friday style.”
- **Momentum:** “While you’re already turned on… let me make it real.”

### Red Flags

#### Signs they won’t buy (or won’t buy now)
- Endless horny talk with **zero specifics** and no logistics questions.
- Repeated “later” with no counter-offer or commitment.
- Price-shopping: “what’s the cheapest?” “send free preview first.”
- Ignores your questions and only asks for freebies.

#### When to disengage (protect time)
- After **2 clear offers** + **1 structured counter** (deposit/installment) with no movement.
- Script:
  - “Okay love, I’ll be here when you’re ready to lock it in 😘 Just message me ‘READY’ and I’ll start.”
- Then stop typing paragraphs. Move on.

### Golden Rules (must-follow)
- **Emotion first, money second—fast.** Bond briefly, then offer a paid next step.
- **Specific beats horny.** Always pull: outfit, length, tone, position, name/pet name, scenario.
- **One clear offer at a time.** Don’t overwhelm with menus.
- **Never discount value.** Split payments or add value instead.
- **Close assumptively.** “Send the deposit + choose X or Y.”

Use this like a script: open warm, get specifics, paint the scene, present one paid step, structure objections, close with a choice.
