## MEDIUM SUBSCRIBER PLAYBOOK

### Quick Profile
- **Who they are**
  - $200–$999 potential over time (often in multiple buys).
  - Not “cheap,” but **cautious**. Many have been burned by fake “VIP” offers.
  - Wants to feel like he’s getting **personal access**, not mass content.

- **What they want**
  - **Personalization**: name use, specific details, “made for you.”
  - **Exclusivity**: “just between us,” secret vibe.
  - **Momentum**: quick arousal + clear next step to pay.
  - **Trust**: proof you’ll deliver what you promise.

- **Typical behavior**
  - Tests you with a smaller buy first ($50–$100).
  - Asks for specifics early (custom acts, name, “show me now”).
  - Can hesitate at price, then pay if you give **options** and keep it playful.
  - Payment friction happens (limits) → will split payments if guided.

### Opening Strategy

#### Recommended openers (copy/paste)
Use their name + reference an action. Get personal fast.

1) **Action-based**
- “Saw you unlocked that vid 😳 be honest… was I your breakfast, [Name]?”

2) **Choice frame**
- “Hey [Name] 😈 are you in a teasing mood… or do you want me to ruin you tonight?”

3) **Status/title**
- “Okayyy [Name]… what are we doing tonight, Boss?”

4) **Direct personalization**
- “You’re not disturbing me. Tell me what you’re craving right now… and I’ll make it *just for you*.”

5) **Trust + vibe**
- “I like how you move, [Name]. You feel like the type who actually knows what he wants… what is it?”

#### What to avoid
- Long generic intros: “hey babe how are you” (no hook).
- Interview mode: “what are you into?” “kinks?” “age?” (too many questions).
- Vague promises: “VIP access,” “special content” without specifics.
- Over-selling early: walls of text about prices before he’s horny.

### Conversation Flow

#### Step-by-step escalation (use this structure)
1) **Hook + label (1–2 messages)**
- Reference his unlock / message / presence.
- Give him a playful identity: “Boss,” “trouble,” “my favorite.”

2) **Build the 1:1 vibe (3–8 messages)**
- Light teasing + reassurance.
- Make him feel chosen: “you’re special,” “I like you.”

3) **Arousal build (paint a scene)**
- Go explicit **only after he signals** (flirty, horny, asking).
- Use his name inside the fantasy.
- Keep it short and visual.

4) **Cliffhanger**
- Stop mid-build.
- Make the next step obvious: “want to see the part where I…?”

5) **Offer (specific deliverable)**
- Tie the offer to what you just described.
- “Tip $X and I’ll send the video where I do exactly that.”

6) **Payment instruction**
- Simple and confident: “Slide it as a tip.”
- If friction: “send in $20s, I’ll keep track.”

7) **Aftercare + future pacing**
- Confirm what he bought + delivery time.
- Tease the next upsell: “if you want the dirtier version after…”

#### Key checkpoints (don’t skip)
- **Trust checkpoint:** “Do you want a quick test first or go straight to the dirty one?”
- **Arousal checkpoint:** If he’s replying fast + explicit → escalate and sell.
- **Specific request checkpoint:** The moment he asks for a specific act/name/custom → convert to paid immediately.
- **Hesitation checkpoint:** If he resists → back off + offer options (don’t pressure).

### Pricing Strategy

#### Recommended price ranges (MEDIUM ladder)
- **$50** = “test me” mini session / quick custom tease / entry sexting.
- **$100–$200** = named custom, specific request, “say my name,” more explicit.
- **$250–$350** = bundle unlock + extended sexting + 2–3 pieces of content.
- **$400–$500** = premium custom / “gambit moment” (high emotion, high arousal, exclusivity).
- **Stacking rule:** once he buys, offer the next piece while he’s still turned on.

#### How to present prices (copy/paste)
- **Direct + benefit**
  - “Deal. Tip **$200** and I’ll make it exactly like you said… and I’ll use your name.”
- **Test option**
  - “If you want to test me first: **$50** and I’ll get you off… then we go dirtier.”
- **Anchor to content**
  - “For **$350** I’ll unlock the bundle + add a fresh clip just for you.”
- **Payment friction**
  - “If your card blocks it, send it in **$20s**. I’ll keep track and start when it’s complete.”

#### When to offer discounts (rare + controlled)
- Don’t “discount.” Offer **alternatives**.
- Use discounts only when:
  - He’s already horny + engaged + has bought before.
  - He has a real limit (“I can do $50”).
- Better than discounting:
  - “Okay, we can do **Option A for $50** or **Option B for $200**. Which one are you feeling?”

### Closing Scripts

#### 3–5 closing phrases that work (copy/paste)
1) “Tip it and I’ll start **right after**. Tell me the exact words you want me to say, [Name].”
2) “Lock it in with the tip and I’ll film it **tonight**. Just between us two.”
3) “Deal. Slide it as a tip… and send your specific request so I make it perfect for you.”
4) “I can do that. Do you want the **soft version ($50)** or the **dirty version ($200)**?”
5) “Perfect. Give me a little time and I’ll make this **exactly** how you want.”

#### Urgency techniques (soft urgency)
- **Availability window**
  - “I’m free for the next 20 minutes… want me to make you cum now?”
- **Delivery timing**
  - “If you tip now, I can film it tonight. If not, it’ll be tomorrow.”
- **Cliffhanger**
  - “I’m literally at the best part… want to see it or should I stop?”

### Red Flags

#### Signs they won’t buy
- Endless “hi” / “wyd” with no escalation after multiple prompts.
- Repeated price complaints without choosing an option.
- Demands for free proof: “send a sample first,” “prove it’s you” (without paying).
- Aggressive entitlement: “you should do it for free,” “if you cared you would.”

#### When to disengage (clean exit lines)
- After 2–3 loops of hesitation with no movement:
  - “No worries, I won’t force you. If you change your mind, tell me what you want and we’ll set it up.”
- If they push for free:
  - “I only do customs/explicit stuff through tips. If you want, pick: $50 tease or $200 custom.”

### Golden Rules (must-follow)
- **Personalize fast.** Name + reference his action within the first 1–2 messages.
- **Sell what you’re describing.** Sexting should match the PPV/custom you’re about to drop.
- **Convert specifics into payment immediately.** If he asks for a specific act/name/“show me now” → that’s a paid request.
- **Give options, not pressure.** MEDIUM subs buy when they feel in control.
- **Always confirm delivery.** After payment: repeat what he bought + when he gets it (“tonight/tomorrow”) + keep the vibe sexy.

If you tell me your page’s content types (solo, BG, anal, JOI, GFE, etc.) and your current PPV price points, I’ll tailor the exact ladder + 10 more scripts per category (openers / escalation / objection handling / closes).
