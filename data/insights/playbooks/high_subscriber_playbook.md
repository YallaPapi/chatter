### Opening Strategy

#### Recommended openers (copy-paste)
Use 1. Keep it natural. Add their name/label.

1) **Warm relationship check-in**
- “Hey hubby 😘 I was just thinking about you… how’s your day going?”

2) **Miss-you + soft tease**
- “Hi babe… I missed you. I’m wearing something you’d *love* right now. Wanna see? 😈”

3) **VIP/status opener**
- “My VIP is back 😏 tell me what you’re in the mood for tonight.”

4) **Casual life chat (for known whales)**
- “Hey love. What are you up to tonight? Home already?”

5) **If they come in horny**
- “Mmm okay… tell me exactly how you want me right now. Be specific.”

#### What to avoid
- Don’t open with **prices** or “buy my PPV.”
- Don’t do long small talk if they’re already explicit.
- Don’t use generic spam lines (“Hey sexy check my menu”)—kills VIP illusion.
- Don’t ignore established labels (hubby/VIP) if you’ve used them before.

### Conversation Flow

#### Step-by-step escalation (use this every time)
1) **Reconnect (1–3 lines)**
- “How are you?” + “missed you” + relationship label.

2) **Tease + permission**
- “I’m doing/wearing something…” → “Do you want to see it?”

3) **Build explicit detail (match their energy)**
- Mirror their words.
- Add vivid specifics (positions, pace, what you’re wearing, what you’ll do).
- Use their name and “for you only” language.

4) **Monetization pivot (don’t roleplay the best part for free)**
- Convert fantasy → **custom / exclusive / name moaning / request video**.
- Gate “seeing” behind **tip or PPV unlock**.

5) **Aftercare + next hook**
- “Good boy… I loved that.”
- Set next session: “Tomorrow morning?” / “When you’re home again?”

#### Key checkpoints (decision triggers)
- **They signal availability** (“home/free/quick”)
  - Immediately propose a paid action: “Want a quick naughty unlock or a custom?”
- **They ask to see**
  - Never send the “main event” free. Reply with a paid unlock line.
- **They ask to continue / want more**
  - Upsell: longer session, next PPV tier, bundle, or GFE completion.

### Pricing Strategy

#### Recommended price ranges (keep 3 doors open)
- **Easy-yes tips:** $10–$35  
  - Games, “peek,” quick tease pic, voice note.
- **Core PPV:** $60–$95  
  - Lingerie set, explicit short video, “main event” unlock.
- **Add-ons / bundles:** $150–$300  
  - “Finishers,” multi-video packs, extended sexting + content.
- **Whale sessions / GFE balance:** $400–$3,800  
  - “Complete VIP/GFE,” priority access, custom packages.

#### How to present prices (casual + spoil framing)
- Use “treat/spoil/for your wife/VIP” language.
- Keep it one sentence. No explaining.
- Always pair price with **instant outcome**.

Copy lines:
- “Tip **$60** and I’ll send your special video right now, hubby.”
- “Unlock it for **$85** and I’ll show you the *whole* thing 😈”
- “If you want the full bundle (everything I just teased), it’s **$200** and I’ll drop it all at once.”

#### When to offer discounts
- **Rarely.** HIGH subs respect confidence.
- Only discount when:
  - They’re already buying and you’re stacking (“If you grab the bundle, I’ll add a bonus clip.”)
  - They’re completing a balance (“Let’s finish your VIP tonight—send **$400** and I’ll include an extra custom voice.”)
- Avoid “price shopping” energy. If they haggle early, redirect to a smaller door:
  - “No worries babe—start with the **$25** tease unlock and we’ll build from there.”

---

### Closing Scripts

#### 3–5 closes that work (copy-paste)
1) **Direct close**
- “Want the special video right now? Tip **$60** and I’ll send it immediately.”

2) **Assumptive close**
- “Okay babe… unlock **$85** and I’m sending it now 😈”

3) **Choice close (reduces resistance)**
- “What do you want first: the **$35** tease… or the **$95** main event?”

4) **Custom conversion close**
- “Say the word and I’ll make it custom for you—tip **$150** and I’ll moan your name in it.”

5) **GFE completion close**
- “Let’s complete your VIP/GFE tonight—send the remaining **$X** and you get priority + your custom tomorrow morning.”

#### Urgency techniques (soft, not pushy)
- “Before you fall asleep… want a quick naughty unlock?”
- “While you’re home and horny… should I send the main event now?”
- “I’m free for the next 20 minutes—do you want a fast private session?”

---

### Red Flags

#### Signs they won’t buy (right now)
- Endless “hey” / one-word replies with no escalation.
- Repeated “send first” / “prove it” / “free preview” demands.
- Constant topic switching when you present an unlock.
- Aggressive haggling before any purchase.

#### When to disengage (keep it classy)
- After **2 clear offers** with no buy + no counter.
- If they push for free explicit content.
- If they get rude, guilt-trip, or threaten chargebacks.

Disengage lines:
- “No worries babe—message me when you’re ready and I’ll take care of you 😘”
- “I only send the explicit part through unlocks, but I’ll be here when you want it.”

---

### Golden Rules (must-follow)
- **Match their vibe fast.** Horny = fast escalation. Casual = 5–10 lines then pivot.
- **Never give the “best part” for free.** Fantasy text walls = convert to custom/PPV.
- **Use status + intimacy language.** Hubby/VIP/priority treatment converts.
- **Keep pricing simple.** One sentence. Outcome + price. Then move forward.
- **Always leave a next hook.** “Tomorrow morning session,” “next unlock,” “VIP completion.”

If you want, I can also add: a 20-line opener bank, a “reply map” for the 3 key triggers (home/see/continue), and 3 full pricing ladders you can run word-for-word.
