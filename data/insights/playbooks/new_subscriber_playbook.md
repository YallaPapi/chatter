## NEW SUBSCRIBER PLAYBOOK

### Quick Profile
- **Who they are**
  - Just joined. Curious. Testing the vibe.
  - Not “trained” yet. They need guidance.
  - Can still spend big early if the moment feels real.
- **What they want**
  - Attention + intimacy first. Content second.
  - A clear role (baby/daddy), a clear direction, and a “next step.”
  - To feel chosen: “this is for you.”
- **Typical behavior**
  - Short replies. Lots of “hey” / “wyd” / emojis.
  - They ask for free (“send pic?”) to test boundaries.
  - They buy when they’re already turned on or emotionally hooked.
  - They stall with “paycheck” when they want it but need a push.

### Opening Strategy

**Goal:** Warm + flirty + role-based. Hook them into replying. No menu. No price.

#### Recommended openers (copy/paste)
1) “heyy bby how are you? 😈”
2) “hey babyyyy have you had a great day?”
3) “Hey gorgeous… I missed you. what are you doing right now?”
4) “hi baby 😇 what kind of mood are you in tonight—sweet or nasty?”
5) “i gotta warn u… i’m about to do something you might not handle 👀”

#### What to avoid
- “Here’s my menu / prices / bundles” in the first messages.
- “Tip me” before they’re engaged.
- Long paragraphs. NEW subs skim.
- Interview mode: too many questions in a row.
- Over-explaining or apologizing.

### Conversation Flow

**Two winning paths:**  
- **Fast horny path** (when they come in sexual)  
- **Slow-burn curiosity path** (when they’re shy/neutral)

#### Step-by-step escalation (use this every time)
1) **Warm check-in + availability**
   - “how are you bby?”
   - “if you need anything or want to talk im just here”
2) **Hook (tease or choice question)**
   - “sweet or nasty?”
   - “want a peek?”
   - “i gotta warn u…”
3) **Role lock (give them a part to play)**
   - “you like it rough right?”
   - “tell me what you’d do to me if i was right there”
4) **Vivid 2–3 line scene (free sample)**
   - “i’m in front of the mirror… bottomless…”
   - “my legs are shaking a little…”
   - “i’m teasing myself slow…”
5) **Convert to a specific next action (PPV as the experience)**
   - “want me to send the full thing here?”
   - “do you want toys… or fingers?”
6) **After they react positively → ask for the tip**
   - “mmm you liked that… do i deserve a nice tip? 😉”
7) **If they hesitate → “now” + support framing**
   - “if you can do it now bby that will help me a lot”
8) **Close + keep them talking**
   - “tell me what you want next… slow and teasing or rough and messy?”

#### Key checkpoints (don’t skip)
- **Checkpoint A: Engagement**
  - They reply fast, ask questions, use pet names, or push for more.
- **Checkpoint B: Desire**
  - They say: “i wanna see” / “do it” / “i can handle it” / “send it”
- **Checkpoint C: Permission**
  - You ask: “should i…?” and they answer yes.
  - That “yes” is your green light to sell.

### Pricing Strategy

#### Recommended price ranges (NEW tier)
- **$31–$40:** quick unlock / first conversion.
- **$100–$150:** when they’re clearly hooked and praising you.
- **$200–$400:** only with strong framing (support/urgency/relationship) + high arousal.
- **Anchor high when the vibe is hot**, then accept what they send without negotiating too much.

#### How to present prices (non-salesy)
Use **tip/support/reward language**, not “buy.”

Copy/paste lines:
- “i made a naughty clip for you… want me to send it here?”
- “i can send the full thing right now 😈”
- “be honest… do i deserve a tip for that?”
- “if you can see it now bby that will help me a lot”

#### When to offer discounts
- **Rarely.** NEW subs learn your boundaries fast.
- Only discount if:
  - They already showed strong desire (“i need it”) AND
  - They’re short *right now* AND
  - You can trade it for something (bigger tip later / bundle / immediate unlock).
- Better than discounting: **add a bonus**
  - “okay… i’ll sweeten it. i’ll add a little extra if you do it now.”

### Closing Scripts

#### 3–5 closing phrases that work (copy/paste)
1) “mmm you liked that… do i deserve a nice tip? 😉”
2) “i can send it right now… but only if you’re actually going to watch it for me 😈”
3) “should i use some huge fucking toys… or keep it slow for you?”
4) “if you can do it now bby that will help me a lot… and i’ll make it worth it”
5) “tell me yes… and i’ll send the full thing here”

#### Urgency techniques (use lightly)
- **“Cooking” loop**
  - “still cooking…”
  - “you sure you can handle it?”
- **Timing pressure**
  - “right now”
  - “before i stop / before i finish”
- **Scarcity via real-life delay**
  - Reply a bit later sometimes + give a simple reason.
  - Then re-enter with heat: “okay i’m back… and i’m horny.”

### Red Flags

#### Signs they won’t buy (or not today)
- “send free” / “prove it” / “i don’t pay for content”
- One-word replies only after multiple hooks.
- Constantly changing the subject when you escalate.
- They ignore your questions but keep requesting.

#### When to disengage (clean exit)
- After **2 hooks + 1 clear offer** with no engagement.
- If they demand freebies repeatedly.

Copy/paste disengage:
- “mm i can’t do free bby 😘 when you’re ready to play for real, tell me what mood you want.”
- “i’ll let you think about it… message me when you want me to make it happen 😈”

### Golden Rules (NEW tier)
- **Hook first. Money second.**
- **Always give a next step.** NEW subs need direction.
- **Make them chase a little.** Tease > reveal > tease.
- **Sell the moment, not the menu.** PPV is part of sexting, not a separate store.
- **Ask for the tip only after arousal/validation.** “Do I deserve…?” works best after “I love it.”

If you want, I can turn this into a **decision-tree message map** (horny opener / shy opener / paycheck objection / “send free” objection) with exact copy-paste branches.
