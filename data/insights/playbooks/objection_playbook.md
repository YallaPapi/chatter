## Price Objections: "I can't afford it" / "Too expensive"

**Success Rate: 45.8% | Avg Sale After: $124**

### What Works

1. **Ask their budget** (Mikko: $2000 sale)
   > "how much can u babe?"

   *Why it works:* Shifts from rejection to negotiation. Gets them thinking about what they CAN spend.

2. **Offer value breakdown** (Zaqueo John: $700 sale)
   > "well i can give a lot in 50 - fucking a dildo, fingering, sucking"

   *Why it works:* Shows what they get for the price. Reframes cost as investment.

3. **Suggest alternatives** without begging
   > Don't say: "Please, I really need this"
   > Do say: "I have something at [lower price] that you might like"

### Tier-Specific Approach

| Tier | Success Rate | Strategy |
|------|--------------|----------|
| LOW | 52.8% | Offer payment flexibility, smaller items |
| NEW | 31.8% | Start with lowest price point, build trust |
| MEDIUM | 38.6% | Bundle deals, show value |
| HIGH | 17.6% | Don't discount - they can afford it, objection is about value |
| WHALE | 33.3% | Rare objection - probably testing you |

### What Doesn't Work

- Ignoring the objection and pushing harder
- Begging or showing desperation
- Immediately offering huge discounts (devalues content)

## Trust Objections: "Is it worth it?" / "How do I know?"

**Success Rate: 43.4% | Avg Sale After: $83**

### What Works

1. **Show confidence without arrogance** (Billy: $1000 sale)
   > "And yeah I do I think all guys have that in them"

   *Why it works:* Answers authentically, shows realness.

2. **Make a personal connection** (Lau: $300 sale)
   > "I love it baby. You look great. My girl. And yes I still love your skin color."

   *Why it works:* Genuine compliment builds trust through intimacy.

3. **Offer a preview or teaser**
   > "Here's a little preview... if you like it, the full video is even better"

### Tier-Specific Approach

| Tier | Success Rate | Strategy |
|------|--------------|----------|
| LOW | 47.8% | Small proof (censored preview) |
| HIGH | 50.0% | Reference their history: "You loved the last one" |
| MEDIUM | 35.0% | Social proof: "This was my most requested" |

## Commitment Objections: "Let me think about it" / "Maybe"

**Success Rate: 35.6% | Avg Sale After: $79**

### What Works

1. **Redirect to something engaging** (Marvin: $900 sale)
   > "What kind of console are you thinking to get babe?"

   *Why it works:* Changes subject, builds rapport, comes back to sale later.

2. **Reduce pressure** (Billy: $200 sale)
   > "You can show to me when you're ready to. No pressure ok?"

   *Why it works:* Removes sales pressure, subscriber feels less defensive.

3. **Create urgency without pushing**
   > "This video is only up for 24 hours, but no pressure"

### Tier-Specific Approach

| Tier | Success Rate | Strategy |
|------|--------------|----------|
| LOW | 40.6% | Patience + small commitments first |
| MEDIUM | 31.2% | Remind of past purchases: "You enjoyed X" |
| NEW | 16.3% | Focus on rapport, not sale |
| HIGH/WHALE | ~23% | They're testing commitment - be patient |

### What Doesn't Work

- "Are you sure?" (sounds pushy)
- Repeating the offer immediately
- Making them feel bad for hesitating

## Timing Objections: "Maybe later" / "After payday"

**Success Rate: 34.6% | Avg Sale After: $67**

### What Works

1. **Acknowledge and pivot** (Arvin: $700 sale)
   > Explained specific need, made personal ask with clear return

   *Why it works:* Gave real reason, specific amount, clear value exchange.

2. **Simple acknowledgment** (Billy: $500 sale)
   > "I'm on est"

   *Why it works:* Didn't push, just continued conversation.

3. **Schedule a follow-up**
   > "No problem babe, when is payday? I'll send you something special then"

### Tier-Specific Approach

| Tier | Success Rate | Strategy |
|------|--------------|----------|
| LOW | 41.1% | They mean it - follow up after payday |
| MEDIUM | 34.3% | "I can hold this for you until Friday" |
| WHALE | 7.9% | Warning sign - may be losing interest |

## Need Objections: "I'm not interested" / "I already have it"

**Success Rate: 36.2% | Avg Sale After: $72**

### What Works

1. **Pivot to understanding** (Marvin: $900 sale)
   > "What kind of console are you thinking to get babe?"

   *Why it works:* Finds out what they DO want.

2. **Soft acceptance** (Arvin: $200 sale)
   > "It's ok babe don't worry"

   *Why it works:* No pressure, maintains relationship.

3. **Offer something different**
   > "What are you in the mood for today?"

### Critical Warning: NEW Tier

**NEW subs have 0% conversion on need objections.** If a new sub says "not interested," they really mean it. Focus on building rapport first, not selling.

---

## The Golden Rules

### DO:
1. **Listen first** - Understand which objection type before responding
2. **Match tier to approach** - LOW needs patience, HIGH needs value
3. **Redirect, don't push** - Change subject, come back later
4. **Use their words** - "You mentioned budget..." shows you listened
5. **Follow up** - Timing objections are future opportunities

### DON'T:
1. **Never beg** - Destroys value and trust
2. **Never discount immediately** - Try value justification first
3. **Never ignore** - Acknowledge the concern
4. **Never push NEW subs** - Build rapport first
5. **Never get defensive** - Stay playful/warm
