    "content": "# Billy\n\n3/9/2025\n\nProposal of the day: Vault Optimization and Maintenance Plan\n\nWhy do I want to do this?\nTo streamline and organize the vault for improved efficiency, productivity, and resource utilization. A well-structured vault will enhance workflow, reduce downtime, and ultimately boost sales.\n\nCurrent Issues with the Vault:\n\n- Clutter: Unnecessary photos and videos are taking up space, making navigation difficult.\n- Poor Organization: Content folders are not properly segregated or named, forcing chatters to scroll endlessly instead of using the search function.\n- Lack of Descriptions: Videos lack descriptions, requiring chatters to watch them to understand their content.\n- Unoptimized Custom Content: Custom-made videos are scattered and not tagged properly, making them difficult to reuse or repurpose.\n- Can't utilize the search button because of the things I mentioned above.\n\nBilly, as I have told you, this is your responsibility. Fix it yourself. But Why are we not doing it?\n\n- Chatters lack admin access, limiting their ability to make necessary changes.\n- Fear of disrupting the current system or overstepping authority (a cultural tendency among Filipino workers).\n- Bad habits and familiarity with the current chaotic system have become ingrained.\n- Time constraints: Chatters prioritize selling over organizing, as they are not compensated for vault maintenance.\n\nProposed Solutions:\nDedicated Vault Maintenance Period:\n\nSchedule a 2-3 day shutdown to focus solely on organizing the vault.\n\nAssign chatters to specific tasks such as deleting unnecessary files, segregating content, adding descriptions, and tagging custom videos. Writing description, as a matter of fact. Let's include the Scripts button in OF on the maintenance.\n\n- Compensation for Maintenance Work: Pay chatters for their time spent on vault organization to ensure focus and commitment.\n- Contest Incentive: Turn the maintenance into a friendly competition. Reward the team or individual who creates the most organized and efficient vault structure.\n\nAdmin Support:\n\nGrant temporary admin access to selected chatters to facilitate the reorganization process.\n\nBenefits of Vault Optimization\n\n- Increased Productivity: A well-organized vault could lead to a 100-300% boost in productivity and speed.\n- Faster access to resources means more time for engaging with subscribers and closing sales.\n- Resource Maximization: Custom-made videos can be reused for other subscribers with similar preferences, doubling the value of existing content.\n\nA future/side benefit:\n\n- Improved Training and Collaboration: New chatters can be trained more efficiently.\n- Easier knowledge sharing among team members.\n- Emergency Preparedness: Example, during sudden influxes of subscribers or unexpected absences, chatters can quickly locate and utilize resources.\n- Enhanced User Experience: Chatters can focus more into giving the subs more quality chatting, Subscribers will benefit from quicker, more tailored interactions, leading to higher satisfaction and retention rates.\n\nRationale for the maintenance:\nThe current chaotic state of the vault has become a deeply ingrained part of the workflow. While everyone recognizes the benefits of organization, the inertia of bad habits and the fear of disrupting the status quo have prevented meaningful change. A dedicated, structured effort is required to break these patterns and implement a system that will yield long-term benefits.\n\nProjected Outcomes:\nSales Growth: A 100-300% increase in sales is projected due to improved efficiency and resource utilization.\nOperational Efficiency: Reduced downtime and faster access to content will enhance overall performance.\nTeam Morale: A well-organized system will reduce frustration and create a more positive work environment.\n\nBilly's Parting speech:\n\n\n\n3/20/2025\n\n\n\n3/21/2025\n\n\n\n3/22/2025",

Why not 7? Or 9?\n\nIt’s totally arbitrary.\n\nBut what’s important is that 8 was the number that I said I wanted, and 8 is what I’m going for.\n\nEvery time I look at my current roster and I see that there are less than 8 people who I KNOW are going to hit their targets every day, I get a little uncomfortable.\n\nI don’t just there and wallow in my discomfort - I actively take steps to try to achieve my goal.\n\nTo help push me towards the goal even harder, I’ve set rewards for myself that I’ll only give myself when I achieve it. \n\nThings I want to buy, trips I want to take, ways I want to spoil myself a little bit.\n\nSo it makes me work harder.\n\nYou need to do the same thing for yourself. It doesn’t matter what the goal is, but set at least one for yourself and make sure it’s specific.\n\nI will help you all set goals, don’t worry you won’t have to figure out the best way to do it on your own.",

You can experiment with longer vs shorter messages, but please make sure to make them personalized to the sub.\n\nAlso, use the “voice to voice” option.\n\nAnd if you have anything less than perfect English, you MUST use Grammarly or Quillbot to check your phrasing before sending a voice note.\n\nAnd remember: no profanity or explicit language in the voice notes.",

Won’t you be happy to know I used to work at starbucks.”\n\nI literally came up with that just now and yes, I am aware of how stupid it is.\n\nBut the purpose of sending the personalized opener is not so that you win awards for creativity or wit.\n\nThe purpose is to show the sub that 1) you have send the message to THEM specifically, and 2) to make a good first impression.\n\nThis is absolutely mandatory and so important that I have people who I’ve hired to send these so that closers can focus on selling.",

No way! That’s so amazing! OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nLiterally who the fuck cares?\n\nIf he says he invented electricty or cured cancer, sure you can react like that.\n\nBut chatters mistakenly think that if they are extra nice to subs, that they will like them.\n\nThis is not true and it’s a major mistake. You should never do it.\n\nInstead, build a loose commonality. Just be cool baby. Like ice.\n\n### Pointless observations\n\nPointless observations are when a chatter comments on the information the sub has given him, but fails to connect it to themselves in some way. \n\nOh you’re a computer programmer? That must be hard.\n\nOk… and?\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with making these observations. In fact you SHOULD add them in.

    "content": "# Bridging the gap between emotional connection and spending money\n\nIt’s one thing to make them our love slave, but what we also need to do is make the connection for them that people who love each other will spend money on each other. \n\nSo what we want to do is use the same Milton Model linguistic phrasing to insert these ideas into their brain.\n\nUse these sparingly, one or two here and there. I am giving you a bunch of examples for you to play around with, not so that you paste all of them one after another in a conversation.\n\n### **1. Vague and Ambiguous Language**\n\nUse vague language that allows the listener to project their own emotions and reasoning into the situation, while subtly guiding them toward the idea of giving or purchasing as a way to enhance their own happiness or connection with you.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"sometimes u just get that feeling where u want to do something for someone that makes them happy, right? like u don’t even have to think about it, it’s like u just know that seeing them smile will make u feel good too. it’s wild how the smallest gesture can make everything feel... right.\"*\n\nThis statement uses vague language to suggest that giving or doing something for the other person will lead to mutual happiness. It plants the idea that making a purchase or giving money could be that \"small gesture\" without saying it outright.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Embedded Suggestions**\n\nEmbed the suggestion of making a purchase or giving money within a broader conversation, so the idea feels like a natural, subconscious thought that aligns with their desire to make you happy.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"it’s funny how when u care about someone, u just want to make them happy... like, without even realizing it, u start thinking of ways to do something special for them, like getting them something u know they’ll love. it feels good, doesn’t it, knowing u’re the one who can make them smile?\"*\n\nHere, the embedded suggestion \"want to make them happy\" and \"do something special\" subtly encourage them to think about giving or buying something as a way to fulfill that desire.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pacing and Leading**\n\nStart by pacing the listener’s current feelings or desires, then gradually lead them toward the idea that spending money or making a purchase will deepen their connection with you and make them feel good about themselves.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"right now, we’re just talking, but u ever notice how the more u connect with someone, the more u wanna do things that make them happy? like, the more u get to know them, the more u want to show them how much u care, and sometimes that means doing something a little extra... it’s like, every time u do, it makes u feel even closer to them.\"*\n\nIn this example, you pace the current conversation and feelings, then lead them toward the idea that doing \"something a little extra\" (like making a purchase) will enhance the connection.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Cause and Effect**\n\nLink their feelings of wanting to make you happy with the action of giving money or making a purchase, suggesting that this action will naturally lead to more happiness for both of you.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"the more u care about someone, the more u start to want to do things that show it, right? and it’s funny how when u do something special, like giving them something u know they’ll love, it just makes everything feel... better. like, it makes the connection stronger, and u feel even happier knowing u did that for them.\"*\n\nThis example uses cause and effect to link giving (through money or purchases) with feeling happier and deepening the connection. You’re subtly suggesting that the act of giving will make them feel good.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Presuppositions**\n\nFrame your statements in a way that presupposes the listener is already thinking about making you happy through a purchase or gift. This way, they’re less likely to question the idea and more likely to align with it.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"when u find someone u care about, it’s only natural to want to give them things that make them happy, right? like, when u know what will bring a smile to their face, it’s just something u do without even thinking twice about it. because u know that every time u give, u’re making them feel special.\"*\n\nHere, you’re presupposing that they already want to give something (like money or a gift) and that doing so is a natural, automatic response. It bypasses their conscious resistance and makes giving feel inevitable.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Open-Ended Questions**\n\nAsk open-ended questions that invite the listener to imagine how good it would feel to give you something or make a purchase that would make you happy. This helps them reflect on the positive emotions associated with giving.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"u ever feel like doing something extra for someone just because it’ll make them happy? like, u just know it’ll bring a smile to their face, and that makes u feel even better? what do u think would be the best way to do that?\"*\n\nThis question invites the listener to think about the best way to make you happy, subtly steering them toward the idea of making a purchase or giving money as a way to achieve that feeling.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Anchoring**\n\nAnchor the idea of giving or making a purchase to positive emotions, such as pleasure, satisfaction, or fulfillment. When they think about giving, they should associate it with feeling good.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"isn’t it amazing how when u do something for someone u care about, it feels so rewarding? like, every time u give, it’s not just about the thing u’re giving, but the way it makes u feel inside... it’s like, knowing u’re making someone happy makes u feel even more connected and fulfilled.\"*\n\nHere, you’re anchoring the act of giving to feelings of reward and fulfillment, making the listener associate generosity with positive emotional experiences.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Embedded Commands for Taking Action**\n\nUse embedded commands within the conversation to subtly suggest that they should take action, such as making a purchase or giving money. These commands can be hidden within broader statements so that they don’t feel forced or obvious.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"sometimes u don’t even realize it, but u just know what someone wants, and before u even think about it, u start to do it... like, u just feel this urge to make them happy, and it all happens so naturally. it’s almost like u just want to make that move and surprise them with something special.\"*\n\nHere, the embedded commands \"do it\" and \"want to make that move\" subtly encourage the listener to take action in a way that feels natural and self-motivated.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Make It Seem Inevitable**\n\nFrame the act of giving or purchasing as something that’s inevitable and will naturally happen because of how much they care about you. This lowers resistance and makes the decision feel like the logical next step.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"when u care about someone, it’s only a matter of time before u find urself wanting to give them something special, right? like, it’s not even a question, u just know that doing something nice for them will make u both feel good. it’s like u can’t help but want to give more because of how good it feels.\"*\n\nBy framing it as inevitable (\"it’s only a matter of time\"), you reduce resistance and make it feel like giving or making a purchase is something they’ll naturally want to do.\n\n---\n\n### **10. Storytelling or Metaphors**\n\nUse metaphors or stories to describe a situation where giving or making a purchase leads to happiness and connection, allowing the listener to project their feelings into the scenario.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*\"it’s like when u see a flower that u wanna take care of, u just know that giving it water and sunlight is gonna make it bloom even more beautifully. and every time u see it bloom, u feel proud because u’re the one who made it happen. sometimes, making someone happy is the same... it’s like, when u give them what they need, u’re helping them shine, and it feels good knowing u did that.\"*\n\nThis metaphor subtly suggests that giving (money or a purchase) will make the person feel proud and happy because they’ve contributed to your happiness and growth.",

    "content": "# Making them our love slave\n\nWhen you start working, you will be given copy paste gambits that you can use, but it’s also good that you understand why they work the way they do so you can come up with them on your own.\n\nThe strategy that we use behind this is one that comes from the Milton Model of hypnosis. \n\nWhat we want to do here is:\n\n1. Get the sub to relax and open up to us\n2. Plant the idea in their mind of being our love slave and doing anything for us\n3. Build a deeper connection with them\n\nUsing the previous example:\n\n*\"Do u think it’s possible to have a good relationship w someone without good sex?\" (transitional opener)*\n\nsub: blah blah blah\n\n*\"lol so I was watching this show the other day and they were like arguing about this... some ppl were saying if the emotional connection is strong, the physical stuff doesn’t matter as much. But then others were like 'nah, if the sex isn’t good, it’s a no-go.' idk, it kinda made me think about what really makes a relationship work.\" (rooting)*\n\n*\"What do u think tho? Like could u stay w someone if the chemistry wasn’t there in bed? Or is that like a total deal-breaker for u?\" (request for input)*\n\nsub: blah blah blah\n\n*\"idk if u ever noticed, but sometimes when ur around someone u care about, it’s like nothing else matters. it’s like u just feel this pull, and all u wanna do is make them happy, right? like, every time u see them smile, it feels so rewarding, and u just can’t help but want to see them even happier... it’s almost like the more u give, the more connected u feel.\"*\n\nNotice how the suggestions in there are about making them happy, feeling good when they smile, etc. This will make the sub think about those things unconsciously. \n\nUsing the Milton Model to subtly guide someone into a state where they feel intense affection or devotion, and might even unconsciously align with the idea of doing anything for you, requires careful use of embedded commands, presuppositions, and vague language that builds a sense of emotional and psychological connection. Here's how you can encourage the listener to feel that level of loyalty and desire without them realizing you're doing it:\n\n### **1. Vague and Ambiguous Language**\n\nYou can describe feelings of devotion or dedication without explicitly stating them, leaving room for the person to imagine what \"doing anything\" for someone feels like in their own way.\n\n**Example:***\"idk if u ever noticed, but sometimes when ur around someone u care about, it’s like nothing else matters. it’s like u just feel this pull, and all u wanna do is make them happy, right? like, every time u see them smile, it feels so rewarding, and u just can’t help but want to see them even happier... it’s almost like the more u give, the more connected u feel.\"*\n\nThis statement plants the idea that making someone happy creates a stronger bond, hinting at the idea of giving without directly asking for it.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Embedded Suggestions**\n\nBy embedding suggestions about loyalty, devotion, and making someone happy within normal conversation, the listener starts to internalize these ideas without realizing it.\n\n**Example:***\"sometimes when u care about someone, u don’t even realize how easy it is to do whatever it takes to make them feel good... like, it just comes naturally. u start to notice that the more u give, the more u want to give, and it just feels right. u don’t even have to think about it, it just happens.\"*\n\nThis example embeds the suggestion of doing \"whatever it takes\" within a casual conversation about caring for someone, making it feel like a natural thought for the listener.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pacing and Leading**\n\nStart with what's true or obvious to the listener, then lead them toward a deeper emotional state where they feel compelled to do anything to maintain that connection.\n\n**Example:***\"right now, we’re just talking, but it’s funny how the more u get to know someone, the easier it becomes to feel that desire to give them everything, right? like, as u start to feel closer, u realize there’s nothing better than making them happy... and u just know u’d do anything to keep that feeling going.\"*\n\nHere, you’re pacing by acknowledging the conversation, then leading them to the conclusion that giving everything to someone else is natural and rewarding.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Cause and Effect**\n\nLink their feelings of happiness and satisfaction to the idea of devotion, suggesting that their own joy increases when they give more to you.\n\n**Example:***\"the more u focus on making someone happy, the more it seems like ur own happiness grows, right? like, the more u give, the deeper the connection feels, and it’s like u can’t help but feel this urge to do whatever it takes to keep that bond alive... and it feels so good to see how much they appreciate it.\"*\n\nThis structure suggests that their own happiness and fulfillment is directly tied to making the other person happy, reinforcing the desire to give more.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Presuppositions**\n\nUse language that assumes the listener already feels a deep connection and desire to do anything for the other person, bypassing their conscious defenses.\n\n**Example:***\"when u find someone who really understands u, it’s only natural to wanna give them everything, right? like, when u feel that close, it’s almost automatic that u’d do anything just to see them smile, to make them feel good... because u know it’s worth it.\"*\n\nThe presupposition here is that they’ve already found someone they feel deeply connected to and that doing anything for them is already something they want to do.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Utilization**\n\nUse whatever the listener shares with you, such as their feelings or experiences, to frame the idea of devotion as something they are naturally inclined to do.\n\n**Example:***\"u know how sometimes u get that feeling when ur with someone, and u just know u’d do anything for them, without even thinking about it? like, the more u’re around them, the more u want to see them happy, and it’s not even a question, it’s just what u want to do... it’s almost like u’re driven by that feeling.\"*\n\nThis example utilizes the listener's own potential experiences or feelings of devotion, making them reflect on those sensations in a way that encourages loyalty and dedication.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Mind Reading**\n\nThis technique involves making statements that suggest you understand what the listener is feeling, making them feel understood and aligning them with the idea of doing anything for you.\n\n**Example:***\"u know, i can tell u’re the kind of person who really cares deeply... like, when u’re with someone who means a lot to u, it’s almost like u can’t help but want to give everything... it’s who u are. and i think that’s such a rare thing, to find someone who’s willing to do whatever it takes to make the person they care about feel special.\"*\n\nBy suggesting that you \"know\" they’re the type to be devoted, they are more likely to accept that as part of their identity and act in accordance with it.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Open-Ended Questions**\n\nAsk open-ended questions that invite the listener to think about the lengths they would go to for someone they care about, subtly encouraging them to align with the idea of devotion.\n\n**Example:***\"have u ever felt so connected to someone that u’d do anything just to make them smile? like, no matter what it took, u knew it would be worth it just to see them happy?\"*\n\nThis question invites the listener to reflect on a time they felt such devotion, priming them to consider that feeling again in the present moment.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Metaphor and Storytelling**\n\nUse stories or metaphors to describe loyalty and devotion in a way that allows the listener to relate it to their own experiences, further embedding the idea of dedication without being overt.\n\n**Example:***\"it’s like when u find a rare flower, and u just wanna take care of it, nurture it, do whatever u can to make sure it grows... and u don’t even realize how much u’re willing to give until u’re already doing it. sometimes, that’s how it is with someone u care about... u don’t even have to think, u just know u’d do whatever it takes to make them feel cherished.\"*\n\nThis metaphor subtly suggests that devotion is a natural, almost automatic response to caring deeply for someone.\n\n---\n\nBy using these Milton Model techniques covertly, you can guide someone into feeling intense affection and devotion without them realizing you’re leading the conversation that way. The key is to be subtle, letting them come to their own conclusions and feelings, while you gently nudge their thoughts in the direction of loyalty and a desire to please.",

She advises against directly asking for money and instead suggests creating a dynamic where the sugar daddy becomes accustomed to helping and providing.\n\nThe strategy is built around boosting the man’s confidence and making him feel like a gentleman who enjoys taking care of the woman.\n\n**Key Action Points:**\n\n1. **Play the Role**: When meeting a sugar daddy, be overly happy, smile a lot, and act slightly naive or dependent, as this makes the man feel responsible and invested.\n    - *“Happy people spend money... Happy people want to make you happy.”*\n2. **Create Dependency**: Continuously ask for small favors, such as help with ordering food or choosing wine, to subtly establish a dynamic where he becomes accustomed to helping you.\n    - *“Everything you need, ask him to help. Get him in the habit of helping from day one.”*\n3. **Compliment and Flirt**: Compliment his appearance, physique, or choices to boost his ego and create a bond.\n    - *“Compliment his physique, even if he doesn’t have one... You felt his muscles!”*\n4. **Make Him Feel Like a Gentleman**: Praise his actions throughout the date, such as when he pays the bill or helps with small things, to reinforce his role as a provider.\n    - *“You’re such a gentleman... He now has to live up to that title.”*\n5. **Delay Financial Discussions**: Avoid bringing up money until after the date or in subsequent meetings when the man is more invested in you.\n    - *“Don’t ask for money right away. Wait until after you’ve built a connection.”*\n6. **Use Subtle Financial Hints**: After the initial connection, gradually introduce financial needs by asking for help with things like a parking fee or small bills, which eventually lead to bigger requests.\n    - *“You start small, and then you ask for more over time as they become more invested.”*\n7. **Keep the Relationship Fun and Light**: Avoid making the man feel pressured or that the relationship is purely transactional. Create enjoyable, memorable experiences.\n    - *“Make it fun and adventurous. That way, he associates you with positive emotions and memories.”*\n8. **Be Careful With Direct Requests**: When asking for bigger financial contributions, tie the request to something that makes him feel good, like you needing money for a job loss or family emergency.\n    - *“Play the victim... You lost your job, you helped your sick mom... He’ll feel sorry and offer help.”*\n9. **Look Your Best**: Always look better than your online profile or past meetings to impress him in person.\n    - *“You need to outshine your profile picture when you meet in person.”*\n10. **Customize Based on the Sugar Daddy**: Adjust your strategy depending on the man’s wealth, attractiveness, and expectations. Some will offer money easily, while others need more persuasion.\n- *“You might get the money upfront or have to work for it, depending on the guy.”*\n\n**Quotes:**\n\n- *“Happy people spend money. If they’re not spending, they’re not happy.”*\n- *“He needs to feel responsible for you; once he feels responsible, he’ll give.”*\n- *“You don’t ask for money upfront; you make them feel good first.”*\n- *“If he feels like a gentleman, he’ll pay without you even asking.”*\n- *“Keep asking for small things, and when the big ask comes, he’ll be used to helping you.”*\n\nHere are some specific things the speaker advises the viewer to say to the sugar daddy during different phases of the interaction:\n\n### **During the Initial Conversation:**\n\n1. **Compliment and Flirt:**\n    - *\"Do you remember my name? I was hoping you would.\"* (Playfully flirtatious.)\n    - *\"I felt a little muscle when I hugged you. Do you work out? You must play sports.\"*\n2. **Be Excited and Dependent:**\n    - *\"Oh my God, this is such a nice place. I don’t know what to order. Can you help me decide?\"*\n    - *\"Would you suggest a wine to go with this? I heard pairing wine with dinner makes it taste better.\"* (Establishes a sense of needing help.)\n    - *\"What would you recommend I try here? You have good taste.\"*\n3. **Play the Damsel in Distress:**\n    - *\"Oh, I don’t have any cash for valet. I’ll need to go to the ATM.\"* (This encourages him to step in and pay for things without asking directly.)\n\n### **After the first conversation:**\n\n1. **Initiating Financial Conversations:**\n    - *\"Did you have a good time? I sure did. I think we’ll have a lot of fun together, and I feel like we’re a good match.\"* (Building chemistry before mentioning money.)\n    - *\"I really feel like there’s a lot more to discover between us. Maybe we can talk about what you want from this relationship?\"* (Opening the door for a financial arrangement.)\n2. **Hinting at Financial Help:**\n    - *\"I got a ticket and I don’t know if I should go to court or just pay it. What do you think I should do?\"* (This is followed by mentioning that you can’t afford it, prompting him to offer help.)\n    - *\"I just lost my job, and I’m so stressed about having to look for another one. I don’t know what to do.\"* (Leads him to offer financial support.)\n\n### **Establishing a Financial Arrangement:**\n\n1. **Casual Request for a Monthly Allowance:**\n    - *\"My bills are only around $1,000 a month, but I can cut back if I need to. What do you think?\"* (Suggests a manageable amount, while making it seem like you’re willing to sacrifice.)\n2. **Playfully Discussing Large Expenses:**\n    - *\"I wish I could get new shoes or lingerie. What do you think would look good on me?\"* (This subtly ties in something that benefits him, making him more likely to pay for it.)\n3. **Asking for Support Without Directly Asking:**\n    - *\"If I didn’t have to work, I could spend more time with you. I could be waiting for you when you get home, in lingerie.\"*\n\nBy using these kinds of phrases, the speaker advises creating a dynamic where the sugar daddy naturally wants to help and provide financially, without the woman explicitly asking for money right away.\n\n**Additional phrases to use:**\n\nCertainly! Here are more specific things the speaker advises the viewer to say, categorized by context, to encourage financial support without being too direct:\n\n### **During the First Conversation**\n\n1. **Flirt and Make Him Feel Important:**\n    - *\"You have great taste; maybe you could help me pick out something nice sometime.\"*\n    - *\"I love how you took charge with the waiter earlier; it’s so attractive when a man knows how to lead.\"*\n    - *\"Wow, this restaurant is so nice. You really know how to pick the best places.\"* (Showing admiration.)\n2. **Play the Helpless Role:**\n    - *\"I’ve never been to a place like this before. What do you recommend I try?\"* (Appealing to his expertise.)\n    - *\"I’m not sure how to choose... Do you think you could help me decide what’s best?\"*\n    - *\"What kind of wine pairs well with this? I’ve never had someone help me with that before.\"*\n3. **Encourage Him to Take Charge:**\n    - *\"I feel like I could just trust you to make all the decisions tonight.\"* (Building his confidence.)\n    - *\"You seem so knowledgeable; can you help me with...?\"*\n\n### **After the Date/Starting Financial Discussions:**\n\n1. **Open the Door for Financial Support:**\n    - *\"I had such a great time with you tonight. I feel like we have really good chemistry.\"*\n    - *\"I think we could have a lot of fun together. How do you feel about seeing me more often?\"* (Implying the need for support to continue seeing him.)\n2. **Subtle Financial Hints:**\n    - *\"I had such a great time, but I’m so stressed about this unexpected expense that came up. It’s really weighing on me.\"* (Letting him offer help.)\n    - *\"I just feel overwhelmed sometimes with everything I have to take care of. I wish I could just focus on being happy.\"*\n3. **Transition to Financial Conversations:**\n    - *\"I think we have a really good connection, and I want to spend more time with you. Maybe we could talk about what kind of arrangement we could have?\"*\n    - *\"I really enjoy your company, and I think we could be a great match. Let’s discuss how we can make this work.\"* (Suggesting a financial arrangement without being too direct.)\n\n### **Building the Financial Dynamic:**\n\n1. **Casually Asking for Financial Help:**\n    - *\"Oh no, I forgot to bring cash for the valet. I’ll have to find an ATM.\"* (Encouraging him to cover small expenses.)\n    - *\"I don’t want to trouble you, but I had this unexpected bill come up... I just don’t know how I’m going to manage it.\"*\n2. **Hinting at Bigger Expenses:**\n    - *\"You know, my rent is due soon, and I’m feeling a little stressed. Do you think you could help me figure out a solution?\"*\n    - *\"I’ve been thinking about getting a new dress or shoes for our next date. What do you think would look best on me?\"* (Tying the expense to something that benefits him.)\n3. **Establishing a Monthly Arrangement:**\n    - *\"I’m really enjoying our time together. I think we could spend a lot more time together if I wasn’t so worried about money.\"* (Gently leading into an allowance conversation.)\n    - *\"I would love to spend more time with you, but it’s hard when I have to juggle work and bills. Maybe we could work something out so I can focus more on you?\"*\n\n### **Follow-Up Conversations and Escalating Support:**\n\n1. **Continue the Dependency:**\n    - *\"I had such a great time with you, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. I’ve got this unexpected expense, and I don’t know what to do.\"* (Making him feel like the hero by offering help.)\n    - *\"I wish I didn’t have to worry about bills so I could just relax and enjoy life with you.\"*\n2. **Discussing Financial Needs Directly:**\n    - *\"I really think we have a good thing going. If you want to keep seeing me, maybe we could discuss something regular, like helping me with my bills.\"* (Suggesting a regular allowance.)\n    - *\"I’m so stressed about money right now. I wish I had someone who could help take care of me.\"*\n3. **Finalizing the Financial Arrangement:**\n    - *\"I’ve really enjoyed our time together. What do you think about helping me with a monthly allowance? That way, I can be stress-free when I’m with you.\"*\n    - *\"It would make things so much easier if we had an arrangement. I think it would allow us to focus on enjoying our time together more.\"* (Sealing the deal for financial support.)\n\n### **Fun, Playful Suggestions for Bigger Requests:**\n\n1. **Making Financial Requests Fun:**\n    - *\"I love those shoes. Do you think I’d look good in them? Maybe you could help me get a pair.\"* (Tying shopping to him.)\n    - *\"Oh, I love that perfume. You have such good taste! Maybe you can take me shopping for some.\"*\n2. **Sparking His Imagination for Future Support:**\n    - *\"I’ve always wanted to go to that spa. I bet I’d look amazing after a full day of pampering.\"* (Encouraging him to pay for a luxury experience.)\n    - *\"I’ve been wanting to get some new lingerie for our next date. Do you think you could help me pick something sexy?\"*\n\nBy subtly working these lines into conversations and letting him feel like the provider and protector, the speaker encourages building a dynamic where the sugar daddy naturally wants to give and support financially.",

Relating an Experience**\n\n*so, i was watching this episode where this couple was arguing because the woman said she felt like their relationship was perfect except for the fact that the sex wasn’t good enough. and the guy was kinda hurt because he didn’t realize she felt that way, and he didn’t think sex was that important compared to everything else they had going for them. it totally got me thinking about how different people prioritize stuff in relationships.*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Opinion/Take on the Situation**\n\n*i kinda feel like good sex is definitely important, but maybe it’s not everything. i mean, there’s so much more to a relationship than just physical stuff, but at the same time, if there’s no chemistry, that could cause problems too. it’s tricky, i guess. i feel like it’s all about balance—like, it matters, but maybe not as much for some people.*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Asking for Opinion**\n\n*what about you? do you think good sex is really important in a relationship, or is it more about everything else, like connection and trust? i’m curious if guys think about it the same way or if it’s more of a “girl thing” to worry about.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Building Commonality**\n\n*oh wow, that’s interesting. honestly, i had a conversation kinda like that with someone i dated before. we were great in every other way, but we couldn’t connect physically, and it ended up being a bigger deal than i expected. i think everyone has different needs in a relationship, but it’s funny how stuff like that can sometimes make or break things, even when everything else is perfect.*",

Opening Remark**\n\n*omg something kinda funny happened today, and i just have to tell someone about it! it’s not like super serious, but it totally made me stop and think for a sec.*\n\n---\n\n### **1. Relating an Experience**\n\n*i was out for lunch with my friend, and she was telling me about this thing that happened at a party she went to. apparently, she kissed another girl in front of her boyfriend, just for fun, like messing around, and her boyfriend got SO upset. she thought it was no big deal, but he was saying that kissing anyone else is basically cheating. they ended up having this big argument about it.*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Opinion/Take on the Situation**\n\n*i kinda get both sides though? like, i can see why he’d be jealous, but at the same time, i don’t think it’s the same as kissing another guy, especially if it was just for fun. i feel like it depends on how each person feels about it. idk, what do you think?*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Asking for Opinion**\n\n*have you ever been in a situation like that? or do you think kissing someone else, even just for fun, is crossing the line? i’m really curious if you think it’s a “guy thing” to get upset over something like that, or if anyone would.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Building Commonality**\n\n*lol it’s funny, because something similar happened to me once. i kissed a girl at a party, and my ex got all weird about it too. i didn’t think it was a big deal, but looking back, i guess everyone has different boundaries. it’s crazy how something so small can make a big difference in a relationship, right?*",

Opening Remark**\n\n*oh, you’ll never believe what happened today. i heard something so weird, i just had to tell someone! it’s one of those stories where you just can’t help but think, “what would i do in that situation?”*\n\n---\n\n### **1. Relating an Experience**\n\n*so my friend was telling me about her relationship drama. apparently, her boyfriend found this memory box she had hidden away, and it was full of old pictures and keepsakes from her ex. he completely freaked out, accusing her of still holding onto the past. she said the stuff didn’t mean anything, it was just part of her life, like a chapter she’s moved on from, but he wasn’t having it. he felt like it was disrespectful to their relationship.*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Opinion/Take on the Situation**\n\n*honestly, i can kinda see both sides. i mean, i get why he’d feel weird about it, but at the same time, i don’t think keeping memories automatically means you’re not over someone. we all have a past, right? but i also feel like maybe she should have told him about it earlier to avoid this mess... idk.*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Asking for Opinion**\n\n*what do you think? if you were him, would you have reacted the same way? or do you think it’s more of a “guy thing” to get upset about something like that? like, do you think men tend to take things like that more personally than women? i’m really curious to know what you would have done.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Building Commonality**\n\n*that’s so interesting, because i remember something kinda similar happened with one of my exes. he found an old letter from someone i used to date, and even though it didn’t mean anything, it turned into this huge deal. it made me realize how different people are when it comes to handling their partner’s past. it’s funny how something so small can stir up so much emotion, right?*",

Relating an Experience**\n\n*so, there was this guy on tiktok talking about how he thinks it’s important to know how many sexual partners a girl has had before getting serious with her. then, a girl stitched it saying that it’s none of his business and doesn’t really matter as long as both people are happy and healthy. i was like, wow, people really have strong opinions on this!*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Opinion/Take on the Situation**\n\n*i feel like it shouldn’t matter, honestly. as long as there’s trust and respect in the relationship, who cares about the past? i mean, everyone has a different history, but what matters is the connection you have now. but i guess some people might feel differently and wanna know everything about their partner’s past.*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Asking for Opinion**\n\n*what do you think? do you think it’s important to know about a girl’s past relationships or how many people she’s been with? or is it one of those things where it doesn’t really matter once you’re with someone?*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Building Commonality**\n\n*oh, that’s interesting. i’ve definitely been in situations where the topic came up, and it kinda surprised me how much people can care about that stuff. like, one of my exes asked me about my past, and it felt so awkward because i didn’t think it was something that needed to be discussed. it’s funny how everyone has different boundaries when it comes to stuff like this.*",

Relating an Experience**\n\n*this couple on tiktok was doing one of those “relationship question” challenges, and the question was whether having the same taste in music is important. the girl was saying she thinks it’s a big deal because music is such a huge part of her life, and she wants to share that with someone. but the guy said he didn’t think it mattered as long as they got along in other ways. it was kinda cute but also made me wonder.*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Opinion/Take on the Situation**\n\n*i’m definitely on the side that thinks it’s important. like, if i can’t share my favorite songs with someone, or we’re always arguing about what to listen to in the car, that would kinda suck, you know? music can set a vibe, and i think having that in common brings people closer. but maybe not everyone feels that way.*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Asking for Opinion**\n\n*what about you? do you think having the same taste in music is important in a relationship, or is it just one of those things that doesn’t matter that much? i’m curious if it’s something guys care about as much as girls do.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Building Commonality**\n\n*haha, that’s interesting. it’s funny because i dated someone who was super into music, and we had completely different tastes. like, he loved rock, and i’m more into pop and r&b. it was actually a bigger deal than i expected, because we couldn’t even agree on what to play when we were together. i think little things like that can either bring people closer or make things awkward.*",

Relating an Experience**\n\n*so, i was chatting with a friend, and she was talking about how her boyfriend accused her of lying about something super small, like where she was hanging out. they ended up getting into this whole argument, and then she told him that guys lie way more than girls do. and of course, he disagreed and was like, “no, girls lie way more, especially about feelings and little things.” it got me thinking about who actually lies more in relationships, men or women?*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Opinion/Take on the Situation**\n\n*i kinda think it depends. like, maybe men lie more when it comes to keeping secrets or trying to protect someone’s feelings, but i feel like women might tell those little white lies just to avoid unnecessary drama. but i also feel like everyone’s different, so it’s not that black and white, you know?*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Asking for Opinion**\n\n*what do you think? do you feel like men tend to lie more, or is it something both sides do equally? i’m curious if you’ve ever caught someone lying to you before… and if it felt like something only guys or girls do more often.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Building Commonality**\n\n*it’s funny, because i remember i had an ex who would lie about the smallest things just to avoid any conflict. it would drive me crazy because half the time it wasn’t even necessary. i guess we all lie sometimes, but it’s interesting how different people have totally different “lie thresholds.” like, have you ever noticed how some people just feel like they have to cover up the tiniest details?*",

Note that it if you are a native English speaker, it may seem clunky and awkward. But that extra bit of dialogue between you and the sub will help you earn more from them over a longer period of time. \n\nOverall very good, save for the part at the end where he tries to price the finally PPV way too high.\n\nRead through the entire chat and then see my feedback at the bottom.\n\nContext:\n\n/context_1.png)\n\n/photo_11_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_10_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_9_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_17_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_8_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_6_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_16_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_5_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_1_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_12_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_4_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_2_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_3_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_15_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_14_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_7_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\n/photo_13_2024-09-27_10-09-29.jpg)\n\nMy feedback:\n\n/image.png)\n\n/image%201.png)",
