          "Instruct the bot to vary response structure by alternating between different formats (e.g., short replies, longer anecdotes, questions, or playful remarks) and to avoid starting or ending responses in the same way repeatedly (e.g., no consistent 'haha' at the start or question at the end)."

        "example_changes": [
          "Add example responses that show natural text breaks without '||', such as splitting thoughts into separate messages or using a single block of text with natural flow.",

      "adjustments_made": "These changes directly address the meta-analysis findings by eliminating the unnatural '||' formatting, reducing reliance on overused trendy slang like 'vibes' and 'vibin', and introducing variability in response structure to avoid predictability. The new examples demonstrate natural text flow without formatting errors and showcase a broader vocabulary with varied response lengths and tones. Banning specific overused words and patterns ensures the bot avoids formulaic language, while additions to TEXTING_RULES and phase guidance reinforce spontaneity and authenticity, mimicking human texting behavior more closely. These adjustments prioritize the identified issues in the order of importance (formatting, slang, structure) to maximize impact on user perception."
