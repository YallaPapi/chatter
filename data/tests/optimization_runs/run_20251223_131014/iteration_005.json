          "evidence": "Issues like 'no progression: ignores his la/bali chat, sales jo', 'no real conversation depth: ignores fan's inputs', and 'ignores threats to block/end convo' show the bot fails to respond to user-specific details, making interactions feel scripted and impersonal.",

        "persona": "horny_direct",
