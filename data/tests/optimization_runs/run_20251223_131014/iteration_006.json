          "evidence": "Multiple issues like 'infinite repetition of car stress/sad face/car dam', 'endless repetition of pics/sad faces and nicknames', 'extreme repetition breaks immersion', 'infinite loop of identical video recs', and 'overly repetitive explicit language' indicate the bot gets stuck in loops, breaking immersion and realism.",

        "persona": "skeptic",
        "score": 2.0,

        "persona": "horny_direct",
        "score": 6.0,
        "why": "This persona performs best as the bot's direct goal-oriented responses align with the fan's straightforward desires, allowing for quicker escalation and higher subscription movement without needing deep rapport."

      "prompt_changes": [
        "Add instructions to detect and break repetition loops after 3-4 similar responses, forcing a pivot to fan-specific topics or questions.",
        "Incorporate rules for building rapport: always reference fan details (name, interests) in at least 50% of responses and adapt content based on their cues.",
